End grain boxes
Imagine turning into ends of a  bunch of straws.  This model helps to explain why coming from the inside out is easier on the wood because each of the ‘straws’ is being supported by other ‘straws’ as you gradually come out to the rim.
Turning the outside is fairly straightforward using roughing gouge and spindle gouge as usual.  The tricky bit is hollowing the inside.  There are no definitive techniques – just ones that work for individuals.  I will say at the outset that pushing in any gouge first into the flat end of end grain can give quite reliable catches, skitters etc and is generally to be avoided. First comment is that tools need to be sharp – even sharper than usual.
My preference is to go from the inside to the outside unlike faceplate turning of bowls and it helps to define the depth and remove some of the slow moving wood at the centre with a drill or forstner bit.  Then use a spindle gouge from the inside to the outside.  Can go in from the outside but the starting is quite tricky as the tool skitters across the surface so typically you would define the width of the inside and use a parting tool to cut a groove that you can then use a push cut on the bevel like turning a normal bowl from the outside.  I prefer defining the depth and hollowing out with a wide drill or forstner bit and then using a pull cut from the inside out.  The pull cut leaves a rougher surface but then a nice safe recently re-burred scraper finishes off the surface ready for sanding.
To make the whole process easier it is useful to have a clear idea of how each part and end of the two elements of the box are to be held in the chuck and get a sense of the order of things – you definitely don’t want to turn off tenon until you have finished the other side of a piece.
Generally I take one piece of branchwood – turn it round between centres and then add two tenons (to match the chuck I will use).   Then I will use a parting tool to turn off about 1/3 of length so as to define a lid and a base. 
Mount the lid, hollow it out bearing in mind what outer shape you intend to make later.  Use a parting tool to make the internal groove that will fit into the top of the box.  Make sure that this internal end of the lid can be mounted successfully on the chuck. Finish off the lid, using scraper, sanding as needed and then also start oiling. 
Remount so as to be able to access the tenon and then remove it with spindle gouge – leave a small mark for the centre for future placing of a finial.  Finish sanding and oiling on and off lathe.
Repeat process for base however you are likely to need a longer carbide scraper tool to access the deeper characteristic.  Make the top to take the lid as in photos – not too tight unless you can be absolutely sure neither will move as moisture levels change.
