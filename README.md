# Welcome to my super website

This is a repository of techniques, sources, scripts, reminders of processes relating to my hobbies and interests.  Also, given that most of what I make is given away, it is also a memory store for me of images of items that I have produced over the years.  The images help to remind me of materials used, shapes and proportions that have worked as well as those I may not want to repeat.. 

At this stage (24th Aug 2019) the website is being transferred from one hosted in Drupal by 1&1 to this one on Github - it will steadily accumulate content.  Thanks to my son Michael who recommended GitHub and who has helped me to get used to Markdown and the processes involved in producing and uploading pages.
