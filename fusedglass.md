## Glass fusing


Glass fusing is the bonding of individual pieces of glass using a kiln. 

Elsewhere (see links) you can find much greater detail as regards the particular temperatures that the kiln is fired at for different effects and there are also other aspects that can be varied such as&nbsp; how long it stays at the required temperature and the curve against time of how it heats up and cools down.

As with most practical pursuits, there are lots of hazards. Frit for example is finely crushed glass and is often spread by filling and then tapping small sieves raised above the target - even the slightest breeze can cause a drift so I do use a full mask. Even the simple cutting of glass comes with dangers beyond the inevitable cuts - in particular you often find that small slivers of glass leap up as you score and the eyes are very vulnerable - again I always use eye protection just in case. You do need a great deal of expensive kit and rather than invest in such I attend workshops at the University of Hertfordshire - around Â£20 per night. You can buy small personal kilns but the size and variety of kit available in the university makes for me the best option.  

I also like working in the company of others - you can learn a great deal by talking with and observing other people - seeing their sucesses and failures as well as sharing your own.
